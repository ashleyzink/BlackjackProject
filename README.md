## Lessons Learned
The thing I really struggled with the most, is figuring out the right amount of classes, and making sure that everything was separated out as it should be. I'm still not sure if I should have maybe added another class or two, to make it feel more complete. I also look forward to coming back to this project and adding in the stretch goals. The basic requirements for this project took longer than I expected, and I didn't make it as far as I wanted.


## How to Run
When you start the program you'll immediately be shown your cards, and the dealer's up card. Don't worry, we've calculated the value so you can think quickly about whether you'd like to hit or stay. After you make your choice, you can either type in a 1 or 2, or just type hit or stay. You can continue hitting until you're comfortable with your number. Just don't hit too many times, or you'll bust and the house will win!
